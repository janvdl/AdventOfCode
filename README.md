# AdventOfCode
My non-AI solutions to Advent Of Code problems. Sorted by year and day.

## Disclaimer

When I first got into AoC in 2024, I had been out of pure CS / SW Engineering for more than a decade. However, it rekindled a love for programming in me and I hastily tried to find solutions to the problems in the early mornings and late evenings, i.e., before and after work. As such, the code is a bit messy. However, I took pride in not leveraging AI/LLM help for the solutions and instead would go back to Wikipedia or an algorithms textbook to try and find a solution. Usually, I just needed to rummage around in my head for an algorithm I learnt about in university in the mid 2000s. :)
